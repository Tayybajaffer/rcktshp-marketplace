<h3><u>RCKTSHP Service Fees</u></h3>

<p>Last Updated June 3, 2015</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>User Account Fees:</b> Setting up a general User Account for the RCKTSHP Service is free;</li>
	<li>RCKTSHP does not charge Users a membership fee;</li>
	<li><b>Exclusivity Period and Exclusivity Exit Fee: </b>When an Employer and Freelancer connect through RCKTSHP they are obligated by the <a href="http://projects.rcktshp.com/terms/">RCKTSHP Terms of Use</a> and <a href="http://projects.rcktshp.com/service-fees/">RCKTSHP Service Fees</a> to maintain an exclusive association with RCKTSHP for that working relationship for a period of four months from the initial RCKTSHP Project commencement date, (“Exclusivity Period”). Following the Exclusivity Period, for that specific Employer and Freelancer relationship, the parties can (if both parties desire), continue to work together outside of the RCKTSHP platform and applicable  RCKTSHP Project  Fees. Where an Employer and Freelancer desire to exit the Exclusivity Period early, the Employer can notify <a href="mailto:service@rcktshp.com">service@rcktshp.com</a> and agree to pay an “Exclusivity Exit Fee” of $200 (which would be invoiced by RCKTSHP). Failure to notify RCKTSHP of intention for a RCKTSHP platform Employer and Freelancer to work outside the RCKTSHP platform within the the four month period is a breach - which carries a penalty of $1000.</li>
