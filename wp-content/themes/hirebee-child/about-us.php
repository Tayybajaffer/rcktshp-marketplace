		<h2>What We Do</h2>	
		<p>RCKTSHP connects students with scholarships, internships and jobs, and career development opportunities. Our goal is to eliminate graduate underemployment and unemployment by providing valuable experience that turns students into qualified professionals. RCKTSHP gives students a dynamic, unique portfolio by bridging the gap between employers seeking freelancers, and students needing experience. </p>

		<div class='about-why' id='economy'>
			<h4>Challenging Economy:</h4>
			<p>The global economy is experiencing some major challenges, including widespread hiring freezes and spending cuts. Full-time jobs have been decreasing while part-time jobs are on the rise; this transition can be seen in an exploding Freelancer economy. </p>
			<p>The online workforce is growing, with freelancers expected to make up 50% of the full-time workforce by 2020. RCKTSHP benefits the local economy, while building the experience of the next generation. </p>
			<p>In 2013, Stats Canada found that only 46% of all enterprises had a website. Of those who had a website only 38% of them had social media integration. The study also showed that small businesses were the ones that had the least online presence. In an age where more and more people are going to the web to do business, this lack of online presence is undoubtedly adversely affecting a large number of enterprises. These businesses often feel they either lack the adequate budget to create an online presence or they feel it’s not worth their time to learn how to use all the new emerging technology. RCKTSHP offers a one-stop shop for these businesses to build their online presence at a fraction of the average cost. </p>

		<div class='about-why' id='unemployment'>
			<h4>Youth Unemployment</h4>
			<p>Youth unemployment is reaching alarmingly high rates, with students turning to survival jobs which they are overqualified for. </p>
			<p>Students are finding themselves in a vicious cycle in which they are unable to get a job because they don’t have experience, but are unable to get experience because they don’t have a job. </p>
			<p>Project work allows students to build up their resume and gain paid work experience to improve their skill set and future employment prospects.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='about-why' id='outsourcing'>
			<h4>Outsourcing Issues:</h4>
			<p>Hiring freelancers often means battling different time-zones, language barriers, and intense project management requirements.</p>
			<p>RCKTSHP is different. We focus on local students with precise market knowledge to eliminate language and time-zone barriers associated with remote freelancers. We link employers to affordable student resources that are available year round. We give employers the chance to “try before you buy” to test if a freelancer is the right fit for the company.  </p>
