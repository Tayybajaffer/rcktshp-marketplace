<p>Last Updated June 3, 2015</p>

<p>These Terms of Use govern your use of the RCKTSHP.com and projects.rcktshp.com websites (the “Website”) and any web, mobile or other services  (together with the Website, the "Service") offered by RCKTSHP Inc. (“RCKTSHP”), a division of Anagram Inc., an Alberta corporation. By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy (located at [INSERT LINK TO PRIVACY POLICY]), all applicable laws and all conditions or policies referenced herein (collectively, the "Terms" or the “Agreement”). RCKTSHP may amend the Terms at any time by posting a revised version of the Terms on the Website. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms. We advise you to review these Terms regularly to stay up-to-date with changes. If a material change is made, RCKTSHP may notify you via the Service, by email, by means of a notice on our Website, or through other methods we think appropriate. Changes which constitute a "material change" will be determined at RCKTSHP’s sole discretion, in good faith, and using common sense and reasonable judgment.</p>

<h4>Purpose</h4>

<p>Through the Service, RCKTSHP offers an online services marketplace for: 1) students and others searching for and applying to work projects (“Projects”) to earn career related freelance work experience (“Freelancers”); 2) companies wanting to hire Freelancers for Projects (“Employers”); 3) students applying for scholarships (“Scholarship Applicants”)( see <a href="http://rcktshp.com/?s=terms">Scholarship Terms of Service</a>); and 4) anyone wanting to read educational articles from the RCKTSHP Website. In these Terms, we refer to those visiting the Website and those using the Services of RCKTSHP collectively as "Users”.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Service offered by RCKTSHP is a platform enabling connection between third party Employers requiring paid work-for-hire from independent Freelancers for specific roles defined in Employer Project postings for a pre-specified fixed price.</p>

<h4>Eligibility to Use the Service</h4>

<p>Currently, all Freelancers and Scholarship Applicants must be individuals and residents of Canada. Employers and other Users can be citizens and/or residents of countries outside of Canada except for those countries listed as ineligible in the <b>Foreign Trade Compliance</b> section of this Agreement.</p>
<p>You are not eligible to use the Service without consent if you are under 18 years of age. If you are between the ages of 15 and 17, you can use the Service with the consent and supervision of your parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years old, provided that your parent or legal guardian also agrees to be bound by the Terms and agrees to be responsible for your use of the Service. Please note that many of the Projects posted to RCKTSHP will require applicants who are of a minimum age of 18. Please request clarification from the Employer if minimum age restrictions are not clearly stated. You are not eligible to use the Service if you have previously been suspended from using the Service for any reason and we have not explicitly authorized you to resume using the Service. We reserve the right to refuse use of the Service to anyone and to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove or suspend a Project, scholarship or User Account at any time for any reason without liability.</p>

<h4><u>Project Site Service</u></h4>

<h4>Employers</h4>

<p>As an Employer, you are solely responsible for asking questions and investigating Freelancers to the extent you feel is necessary before you enter into a contractual work agreement with a Freelancer in accordance with the <b>Relationship between Client and Freelancer</b> section of this Agreement. Your decision to hire, and enter into a work agreement with, a Freelancer is voluntarily and shall be made at your sole discretion and risk. RCKTSHP does not guarantee that Freelancers will be at the experience, skill and quality level they have indicated in their profile, or that the Freelancer will complete a Project to your desired expectation. Further, RCKTSHP does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties for or about the quality, timeliness, accuracy or results of any Freelancers work output, or the truth or accuracy of employment history, reviews, ratings or content posted on the Website or otherwise made available through the Service.</p>

<h4>Freelancers</h4>

<p>As a Freelancer, you are solely responsible for asking questions and investigating Employers to the extent you feel is necessary before you accept a Project and enter into a contractual work agreement with a Freelancer in accordance with the <b>Relationship between Client and Freelancer</b> section of this Agreement. Your decision to accept any Projects, and enter into a work agreement, with an Employer is voluntarily and at your sole discretion and risk.

<h4>Exclusivity Period</h4>


<p>When an Employer and Freelancer connect through RCKTSHP they are obligated by the <a href='<?php site_url() ?>/terms/'>RCKTSHP Terms of Use</a> and RCKTSHP Service Fees to maintain an exclusive association with RCKTSHP for that working relationship for a period of four months from the initial RCKTSHP Project commencement date, (“Exclusivity Period”). Following the Exclusivity Period, for that specific Employer and Freelancer relationship, the parties can (if both parties desire), continue to work together outside of the RCKTSHP platform and applicable  RCKTSHP Project  Fees. Where an Employer and Freelancer desire to exit the Exclusivity Period early, the Employer can notify service@rcktshp.com and agree to pay an “Exclusivity Exit Fee” as described in the <a href='<?php site_url() ?>/service-fees/'> RCKTSHP Service Fees</a>.</p>

<h4>Relationship between Client and Freelancer</h4>

<p>RCKTSHP is not a party to the dealings between Freelancer and Employer. RCKTSHP makes the Website and Service available for Employers to identify and determine the suitability of Freelancers for Projects posted by Employers and for Freelancers to identify and determine the suitability of Employers and Projects for the Freelancer. Both Freelancer and Employer agree that, when a Freelancer accepts a Project from an Employer, that Freelancer and Employer are deemed to have entered into RCKTSHP’s prescribed form of Independent Contractor Services Agreement. The terms of that agreement are available here:<a href='<?php site_url() ?>/contractor-agreement/'> Independent Contractor Services Agreement</a>.</p>

<h4>Disputes</h4>

<p>RCKTSHP is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between Freelancers and Employers. You agree that any such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada and you hereby agree to submit and attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta with respect to the resolution thereof.

<p>In addition to the foregoing, RCKTSHP is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between any Users, or between Users and any third party arising in connection with the use of the Service.
