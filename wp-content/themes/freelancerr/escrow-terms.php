	<p>Last Updated May 1, 2015</p>

	<p>These RCKTSHP Escrow Payment Terms for Fixed Price Projects (Escrow Terms) incorporate all terms, conditions, and policies of the Website and the Service, including the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. These Escrow Terms are effective May 1, 2015. RCKTSHP may amend the Escrow Terms at any time by posting a revised version of the Terms on the Website. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms. We advise you to check the website regularly to stay up-to-date with changes.  Capitalized terms not expressly defined herein shall have the same meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.</p>

	<h4>A) Online Agreement:</h4>

	<p>When a Freelancer applies for a Project posted on the Website, in order to accept such application, an Employer must deposit the full amount of the fixed price specified for the Project in their posting into an Escrow Account (“Escrow”).  By a Freelancer accepting a Project by clicking “Submit for Approval” and an Employer agreeing to fund Escrow by clicking “Accept/Start Project”, the Employer and the Freelancer shall be deemed to have agreed (i) to be bound by these Escrow Terms, effective on the date that the Freelancer accepts the Project in the manner aforesaid; and (ii) that they are able to receive & download electronically, and view or print, RCKTSHP’s Escrow Terms.</p>

	<h4>B) Cancellations & Refunds:</h4>

	<p>It is always strongly recommended that an Employer and a Freelancer work together to arrive at a mutual agreement if refunds or cancellations of a Project are necessary. If funds for a Project are held in Escrow, refunds and cancellations must be initiated by the Employer or the Freelancer in accordance with the following steps:</p>

	<h5>B.1) Employer Cancellation.</h5>

	<p>Where the Employer desires to cancel a Project with funds held in Escrow, the Employer must set the work status to ‘Canceled’ and click ‘End Project.’, the Freelancer and the Employer agree that PayPal shall be irrevocably authorized and instructed to release to the Employer immediately all Escrow funds related to the Project. In the event that the Freelancer disputes the cancellation, by contacting the employer directly,  RCKTSHP encourages the Employer and the Freelancer to work together to arrive at a mutual agreement. If the parties are unable to agree on a resolution, then the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the section entitled <b>Disputes</b> in the Terms of Use.</p>

	<h5>B.2) Freelancer Cancellation. </h5>

	<p>Where the Freelancer desires to cancel a Project with funds held in Escrow, the Freelancer must mark the project ‘Incomplete,’ and click ‘Update.’ From this point, the Employer must acknowledge the Freelancer’s desire to withdraw from the Project by changing the status to ‘Canceled’ and clicking ‘End Project’, upon which the Freelancer and the Employer agree that PayPal shall be irrevocably authorized and instructed to release to the Employer immediately all Escrow funds related to the Project.</p>

	<h4>C) Employer sets Work Status to “Incomplete”:</h4>

	<p>In those situations where Freelancer has set Work Status to “Complete” and Employer disagrees by setting Work Status to “Incomplete”, Freelancer has the option, for five days from recieving the incomplete notification, of clicking “Open Dispute” as a show of their own disagreement. By opening a dispute, the funds in Escrow are locked for five days. In these situations, It is always strongly recommended that an Employer and a Freelancer work together by using the available communication channel in the Workspace (available upon opening a dispute) to arrive at a mutual agreement. Upon the Freelancer and Employer arriving at a mutual agreement to release funds, Employer please advise RCKTSHP by email at <a href='mailto:disputes@rcktshp.com'>disputes@rcktshp.com</a>.  If the parties are unable to agree on a resolution within the five days, the Project is marked as closed and the Escrow funds are returned to the Employer. At this stage, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the section entitled Disputes in the <a href='<?php echo site_url()?>/terms/'>RCKTSHP Terms of Use</a>.</p>

	<h4>D) Release Conditions:</h4>

	<p>The Employer and the Freelancer hereby irrevocably authorize and instruct PayPal to release the applicable amount of Project Escrow funds to the Freelancer Escrow Account or to the Employer Escrow Account, as applicable, via the Website, in accordance with one or more release conditions provided below or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Release amounts will be delivered to the applicable Escrow Account in accordance the Terms of Use, these Escrow Terms and the applicable Employer or Freelancer instructions.</p>

	<h4>Escrow Fund Release Conditions:</h4>
