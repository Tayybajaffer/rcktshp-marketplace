    <p>Last Updated Apr 22, 2015</p>

    <p>This Independent Contractor Services Agreement (the “Agreement”) between Employer and Freelancer (each a “Party” and, collectively, the “Parties”) is made and entered into effective as of the date that Freelancer clicked “Accept/Start Project” on the RCKTSHP Website (the “Effective Date”). Your continued use of the Website after that date will signify your agreement to the terms of this Agreement. Revisions to this Agreement will be posted to the Website. Please be sure to visit the Website regularly to view updates.  This Agreement incorporates all of the terms and policies from the Website, including the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Agreements and all related policies referenced in or linked from that document.  Capitalized terms not expressly defined herein shall have the same meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.</p>

    <p>The Employer requests the Freelancer to perform services for the Employer as defined in the Project description terms posted by the Employer and applied for and accepted by the Freelancer on the Website (the “Project Agreement”).</p>

    <p>The Parties therefore agree as follows:</p>

    <h4>1.0.Term and Termination.</h4>

Upon termination, the Freelancer will deliver to the Employer any Work Product that has been paid for by the Employer and return any Confidential Information of the Employer in the possession of the Freelancer.</p>

    <h4>2.0. Freelancer Services.</h4>

    <p>2.2. The Freelancer shall provide the necessary equipment to perform the Agreed Services. If the Freelancer has obtained employees or agents (the "Freelancer Personnel"), the Freelancer shall be solely responsible for all costs associated with the Freelancer Personnel.</p>

    <p>2.3 As a result of providing the Agreed Services, the Freelancer or Freelancer Personnel may create certain work product (the "Work Product").</p>

    <p>2.4.

    <p>2.5. The Agreed Services shall be performed for the specified fixed price indicated in the Project Agreement. The Freelancer shall notify the Employer of the completion of Agreed Services and submit a request to release payment. The Employer will accept the request to release payment unless they are not satisfied with the performance or results of the Agreed Services, in which case the Employer can share feedback with the Freelancer through the Clarification Board.

The Employer shall not be responsible for federal, provincial or state, or local taxes derived from the Freelancer's net income earned in performing the Agreed Services, or for the withholding and/or payment of any federal, provincial or state, or local income or other payroll taxes, workers' compensation, disability benefits or other legal employment obligations applicable to the Agreed Services performed by the Freelancer. The Freelancer shall be responsible for all reporting and subsequent tax and other payments required by applicable law</p>

    <p>2.7 The Freelancer will assist the Employer in every reasonable way, including by signing any required documents or instruments, both during and after the Term of this Agreement, to obtain and enforce any intellectual property rights related to the Work Product.

    <h4>3.0. Independent Contractor Status.</h4>

     <p>3.1. The Parties intend that the Freelancer and any Freelancer Personnel be engaged as independent contractors of the Employer.

     <h4>4.0. Ownership.</h4>

     <p>4.1. Upon receipt of payment from the Employer, all Work Product, including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights in the Work Product, will be the sole and exclusive property of the Employer. To ensure the Employer's complete ownership of all rights, titles and interest in the Work Product, the Freelancer hereby agrees to transfer and assign to, and waive in favour of, as applicable, the Employer any and all rights, titles and interests throughout the world that the Freelancer or Freelancer Personnel may have in and to any and all Work Product. This transfer, assignment and waiver includes, but is not limited to, the right to publish, distribute, offer for sale, sell, make derivative works of, edit, alter or otherwise use the Work Product in any way the Employer sees fit, whether now known or later developed.</p>

     <p>5.1.

    <h4>8.0. Liability. </h4>

    <p>EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTIES’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BODILY INJURY, DEATH, LOSS OF REVENUE OR PROFITS OR OTHER BENEFITS, OR CLAIMS BY ANY THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THE PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    <p> THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED HEREIN ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES MADE BY THE PARTIES HEREUNDER.

    <h4>10.0 Payment Terms.</h4>

    <p>10.1. When a Project is authorized as completed by an Employer, by the Employer clicking the “Pay” button, the funds related to the Project are released from the PayPal Escrow Account to the Freelancer, in accordance with the RCKTSHP Escrow Payment Terms for Fixed Price Projects (accessible via the Website). When releasing the funds, PayPal will credit the Freelancer Escrow Account and then deduct and disburse to RCKTSHP a 15% Service Fee collected by RCKTSHP for creating, hosting and maintaining the Website and Service and covering the costs of the Escrow fund PayPal transaction fees and any applicable State/Provincial and Federal tax that RCKTSHP is required to charge to Freelancer.</p>

    <p>10.2. The Employer and the Freelancer agree that payments from Escrow may be delayed or withheld in the event that RCKTSHP, in its sole and reasonable discretion, requires additional information from the Employer or the Freelancer for reasons of proof of identification or suspected fraud, or if RCKTSHP believes, in its reasonable opinion, that the Freelancer payment may be subject to dispute.</p>

    <p>10.3. In the case of non-payment by the Employer of funds due to the Freelancer, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the section entitled <b>Disputes</b> in the Terms of Use.</p>

    <p>10.4. <b>Exclusivity Period and Exclusivity Exit Fee:</b> When an Employer and Freelancer connect through RCKTSHP they are obligated by the <a href="<?php site_url() ?>/terms/">RCKTSHP Terms of Use</a> and <a href="<?php site_url() ?>/service-fees/">RCKTSHP Service Fees</a> to maintain an exclusive association with RCKTSHP for that working relationship for a period of four months from the initial RCKTSHP Project commencement date, (“Exclusivity Period”). Following the Exclusivity Period, for that specific Employer and Freelancer relationship, the parties can (if both parties desire), continue to work together outside of the RCKTSHP platform and applicable  RCKTSHP Project  Fees. Where an Employer and Freelancer desire to exit the Exclusivity Period early, the Employer can notify service@rcktshp.com and agree to pay an “Exclusivity Exit Fee” of $200 (which would be invoiced by RCKTSHP). Failure to notify RCKTSHP of intention for a RCKTSHP platform Employer and Freelancer to work outside the RCKTSHP platform within the the four month period is a breach - which carries a penalty of $1000.</p>
