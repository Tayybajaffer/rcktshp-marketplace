	<p>We may provide your Personal Information to third parties that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as processing your payments. These third parties are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are obligated to keep such information confidential. Some of our webpages utilize framing techniques to serve content from our service providers while preserving the look and feel of our Website, such as when you enter credit card information. Please be aware that you are providing your Personal Information to these third parties and not to RCKTSHP or the Website.</p>

	<p>If RCKTSHP is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets or a bankruptcy proceeding, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</p>

	<h4>How We Store and Protect Your Personal Information</h4>

	<p>We may store Personal Information in locations outside our direct control (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>

	<p>We use Security Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt sensitive Personal Information (such as your email or password) before it travels over the Internet. Credit card numbers are never stored on our database or servers.</p>

	<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, RCKTSHP cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at <a href='mailto:privacy@RCKTSHP.com<'>privacy@RCKTSHP.com</a>.</p>

	<h4>Compromise of Personal Information</h4>

	<p>We will promptly notify those persons whose Personal Information is compromised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RCKTSHP does not accept liability for any unintentional disclosure of Personal Information or a disclosure that occurs due to a security breach of our systems or facilities.</p>

	<h4>User Access and Choice</h4>

	<p>You may, of course, decline to submit Personal Information to us, in which case, you may not be able to become a User or use certain functions of the Service.</p>

	<p>If your Personal Information changes, you may correct, update, amend, remove, or ask to have it removed by making the change on your User Account "Settings" page or by contacting the email address listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your User Account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

	<h4>Notification, Electronic Communication and Opt-Out</h4>

	<p>You consent to our using your email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by applicable law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may not opt out of some Service-related communications.
